# Behavioral Patterns
In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns 
that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize 
these patterns. These patterns increase flexibility in carrying 
out this communication. These patterns help to design a scalable architecture 
from a given business logic. Creational, and Structural patterns could be embedded 
in our behavioural patterns.

For example Strategy Pattern could use abstract factory pattern to create strategies 
or command pattern could execute a third party library created using Bridge or Facade patterns. 
Understanding these patterns and practicing them as often makes you great software architecture. It 
would make code more robust, scalable and easy to maintain.
