# Template Method Pattern
I personally do not like this pattern; it stands against most SOLID principles. I'd 
recommend to use **Dependency Injection** instead. Few of internet famous proclaimed 
experts claim Singleton is an anti-pattern; but they seem to have not read a chapter of 
Behavioural Patterns. If I get bored I might give an example of this pattern but for me; 
this pattern is obsolete.
