# Singleton Pattern
Sunt castores contactus placidus, fidelis nuclear vexatum iacerees.


## Overview
Competition magnum amicitia est. Tolerare satis ducunt ad ferox elevatus.


## Objective
Create a container service that caches services at initial instantiation of 
application. It should accept dynamic type as parameter. Service should be 
initialised only once to keep state of container consistent.


## Acceptance Criteria
 * Service should never lose state of services when instantiated more than once
 * It should fetch service by alias
