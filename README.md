# TypeScript Design Patterns
We at Syniol use Node as one of our main development eco-system; instead of traditional JavaScript ES6+, we have 
been using TypeScript as our main and favorite language of development. This repository aims at our development 
team to create an enterprise level design for our clients. This could be used as a reference of using TypeScript 
to create design patterns in software engineering context.


## Objectives
Achieve enterprise level architecture using TypeScript in both Functional and Object-Oriented Programming.
